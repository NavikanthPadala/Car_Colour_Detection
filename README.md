**Car Colour Detection
Overview**

This project implements a Car Colour Detection Model using CNNs and OpenCV to classify the dominant colour of a car from an uploaded image.

**Features**
Detects the primary car colour from images.

Supports multiple colour categories (e.g., Red, Blue, Black, White, Silver, etc.).

Utilizes OpenCV for colour segmentation and preprocessing.

Lightweight and suitable for real-time applications.

**Tech Stack**

Python, TensorFlow/Keras – Model training and inference

OpenCV – Colour space conversion (RGB → HSV/LAB)

NumPy – Pixel-level operations

**Dataset**

Contains thousands of car images labeled by colour.

Augmentation used for better generalization under different lighting.

**Results**

High accuracy in detecting car colours.

Robust against varied environments and backgrounds
